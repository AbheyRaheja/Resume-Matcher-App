Interview talking points (short):
- I used Terraform to declare infra as code. I can explain S3, IAM role, RDS, EC2, DynamoDB and why each is useful for MLOps.
- I used MLflow for experiment tracking; training script logs metrics and saves model artifacts.
- I used DVC to declare the training pipeline stage; in an interview I can explain how to push data and models to remote storage.
- For CI/CD I used GitHub Actions to run a small training job and could extend it to push images and deploy infra.
- The training script experiments with 3 model families; I can show the results CSV and explain how to pick a model based on F1/accuracy and production constraints.
